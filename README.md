# Arabic-Text-To-Speech-Synthesizer
In this project we used the concatenative synthesis process. This approach is based on
the concatenation (or stringing together) of segments of recorded speech. Generally,
concatenative synthesis produces the most natural-sounding synthesized speech. However,
differences between natural variations in speech and the nature of the automated techniques
for segmenting the waveforms sometimes result in audible glitches in the output.
